## **Python Automation Scripts**

This section provides detailed descriptions of the Python scripts included in the `helper_scripts/` folder of the repository. These scripts automate common setup tasks, making it easier to configure and manage your Post Fiat wallet.

### **Virtual Environment Setup**
**File**: `helper_scripts/setup_env.py`

This script automates the creation and activation of a virtual environment and installs all necessary dependencies.

#### Usage:
1. Run the script from the project root:
   ```bash
   python helper_scripts/setup_env.py
   ```
2. Follow the printed instructions to activate the environment.

#### Features:
- Ensures a clean virtual environment.
- Automatically installs all dependencies.

### **Configure Trustlines Script**
**File**: `helper_scripts/configure_trustline.py`

This script adds a trustline for the PFT token programmatically, ensuring your wallet is ready to interact with the Post Fiat ecosystem.

#### Usage:
1. Open the script and replace the placeholder values (`rYourWalletAddress` and `sYourSecret`) with your wallet's address and secret.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python helper_scripts/configure_trustline.py
   ```

#### Features:
- Automates trustline configuration with the PFT token issuer.
- Prevents manual entry errors.

### **Automate Wallet Updates**
**File**: `helper_scripts/update_client.py`

This script updates the Post Fiat wallet repository and reinstalls dependencies.

#### Usage:
1. Run the script from the project root:
   ```bash
   python helper_scripts/update_client.py
   ```

#### Features:
- Automates `git pull` to fetch the latest code.
- Reinstalls all required dependencies after updates.

---

### **Submit a Handshake Script**
**File**: `helper_scripts/submit_handshake.py`

This script automates sending a handshake transaction, ensuring you can quickly verify your wallet with the Post Fiat system.

#### Usage:
1. Open the script and replace the placeholder values (`rYourWalletAddress` and `sYourSecret`) with your wallet's address and secret.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python helper_scripts/submit_handshake.py
   ```

#### Features:
- Automatically sends a handshake with the correct memo and transaction amount.
- Verifies successful submission via XRP Ledger.
